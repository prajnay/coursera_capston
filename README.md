A project to analyze the neighbourhood specfically toronto

## The Problem its going to address

Due to different modes of transports being available at relatively cheap prices nowadays and the relax immigration rules of Canada large amounts of Indians are happen to be shifting to major cities like Toronto. Therefore, new people who are shifting to a new city don't really have the knowledge of the neighbourhood. So for a company who is into renting an apartment/house. Would be able to serve the Indian customer better if they are able to figure out in which neighbourhood the most Indian as Indians generally prefer to live in a place where there are other Indians and using the data can be extremely helpful.

To find the perfect neighbourhood for Indians we are going to analyse the amount of Indian restaurants in each borough as well as neighbourhood. The reason being the places where there is more Indians restaurants there tends to be more Indians.


## Data which is going to be used

The Data needed to solve the problem is going to be relatively easy to gather so first we are going to get all the pin codes in Toronto so that we can make clusters of neighborhoods based on the pin codes which can be retrieved from Wikipedia. After this, we are going to use the Foursquare data to get the indian restaurant  and then analyse it based on location to determine which place is best for indians to live in
