A project to analyze the neighbourhood specfically toronto

## The Problem its going to address

Due to different modes of transports being available at relatively cheap prices nowadays. Because of this the number of people shifting from one city to another or one country to another for more job opportunities. Therefore, new people who are shifting to a new city don't really have the knowledge of the neighborhood. So for a company who is into renting an apartment/house, would be able to serve their customer better if they recommend the house based on their preference. For example, If a customer needs a house near public transport and also with a lot of coffee shops nearby then the company would ideally recommend the house meeting. Therefore, We should use the power of the data science to cluster neighborhood of the city(Toronto in this case) and use the power of Foursquare location to filter those clusters to find the perfect neighborhood for the customer. This would also be cost-effective as it would save the time of employees showing different houses to the customer which they might not be interested in.
